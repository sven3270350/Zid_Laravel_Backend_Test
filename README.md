## Backend Assignment

## Task
You were given a sample [Laravel][laravel] project which implements sort of a personal wishlist
where user can add their wanted products with some basic information (price, link etc.) and
view the list.

#### Refactoring
The `ItemController` is messy. Please use your best judgement to improve the code. Your task
is to identify the imperfect areas and improve them whilst keeping the backwards compatibility.

#### New feature
Please modify the project to add statistics for the wishlist items. Statistics should include:

- total items count
- average price of an item
- the website with the highest total price of its items
- total price of items added this month

The statistics should be exposed using an API endpoint. **Moreover**, user should be able to
display the statistics using a CLI command.

Please also include a way for the command to display a single information from the statistics,
for example just the average price. You can add a command parameter/option to specify which
statistic should be displayed.

## Open questions
Please write your answers to following questions.
